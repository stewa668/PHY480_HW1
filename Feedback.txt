# HW grading scale: check(++) --> excellent (good code and analysis AND also completed bonus problem)  
#                   check(+) --> excellent (good code and analysis)  
#                   check    --> satisfactory (minor shortcomings in code and/or analysis)
#                   check(-) --> significant problems w/code or analysis

1) Problem 1 (area.cpp embellishments): 

Your code looks great.  

2)Problem 2 (sum up/down): 

Your figure looks right and your analysis is spot on-- it's 
just a bit more complicated version of the 1+eps+eps... vs eps + eps +...+1 
problem we did in class. So the downward sum is more precise.  

3) Problem 3 (bessel functions): 

Again, your results and analysis look great. 

(Sidenote: If interested, you can understand numerical value of the slope between x=1 and 10
using the short-distance x << l expressions of the spherical bessel and neumann functions. See Ch. 4 
notes. I wonder if one can play similar games for the VERY steep 
region above x = 30 using the asymptotic x >> l expressions for jl(x) and nl(x).)

4) Extra problem (roundoff distribution):
Looks good to me!

##### HW grade = check(++) 

Great job. (And sorry for depriving you of your beloved matplotlib ;)).
